5. 2.2 Legal: Intellectual Property - Third Party Sites/Services
Guideline 4.0 - Design


We noticed an issue in your app that contributes to a lower quality user experience than Apple users expect:

- Your app was not optimized to support the device screen size or resolution. 

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your app to address all instances of this type of issue.

Resources

For information on improving and enhancing your app:

- Watch the video The Ingredients of Great Apps to understand the basics of great apps.
- Watch the video iPhone and iPad User Interface Design for practical design tips.
- Watch iOS Development Videos to learn about programming and design tips.
- Review the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and ensure that your app's interface and design adhere to these guidelines.

Guideline 4.2.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality


We noticed that your app only includes links, images, or content aggregated from the Internet with limited or no native iOS functionality. Although this content may be curated from the web specifically for your users, since it does not sufficiently differ from a mobile web browsing experience, it is not appropriate for the App Store.

Next Steps

We encourage you to review your app concept and work towards creating an app that offers customers an engaging and lasting experience that also meets the App Store’s high expectations for quality and functionality.

Apple Developer includes a variety of design and development resources. Download iOS templates from Apple UI Design Resources, learn more about crafting intuitive, well-designed apps with the Design Video collection, and review the iOS Human Interface Guidelines for best practices to follow when designing apps for the App Store.

Guideline 5.2.2 - Legal


Your app contains content or features that may infringe upon rights owned by news and media outlets.

Your app and its contents should not infringe upon the rights of another party. In the event your app infringes another party’s rights, you are responsible for any liability to Apple because of a claim.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please attach documentary evidence in the App Review Information section in App Store Connect. In accordance with section 3.2(f) of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, you acknowledge that submitting falsified or fraudulent documentation can result in the termination of your Apple Developer Program account and the removal of your apps from the App Store. Once Legal has reviewed your documentation and confirms its validity, we will proceed with the review of your app.

Alternatively, please make the necessary changes to your app so that it does not infringe upon the rights of a third party. For example, before accessing the news articles:

- Include links to third-party news articles that launch in a web browser outside of the app.
or
- Require the user to configure third-party RSS feeds/sources.

Please see attached screenshots for details.

1.3.1）申诉    

尊敬的苹果审核团队您好，
    对于之前违反相关条款，我们深感抱歉，我们也一直在积极配合解决我们的问题，但对于我们应用最近审核结果我们有以下疑问，特提起上诉：
   首先，此次审核结果反馈我们违反了5.2.2指南，侵犯了第三方权益，但并未提供具体侵犯内容，我们知道5.2.2指南是一个大范围，如果我们不知道具体侵犯了那一方的权益，我们也就无法对应用做相关更改。
 其次，在之前我们根据要求提供了相关证明材料，我们提供的证明文件是得到相关授权方授权依法享有合作方提供的内容服务，同时也在中国国内各大应用市场上线，反馈结果并未说明我们的文件是什么原因不起作用，也就是说是我们的文件不被你们认可还是文件本身不足以证明我们并未侵犯相关方权益。
 最后，我们在应用开始是提供了相关第三方内容说明，列出了相关方RSS源，并提醒用户阅读其条款，同时我们在应用列表中标明了来源在详情页也预留了查看原文链接可以通过Safari打开查看原文，但审核结果并未告知我们的这些更改是否符合审核指南，是否能解决现有问题。
   我们一直在积极配合整改，我们希望能够尽快解决相关的问题，能够得到具体的拒绝原因，能够提供给我们一些解决方案，我们十分想去解决但我们无法确定具体原因，反馈结果总是大的范围，并未提供具体的原因，如果我们的确侵犯了相关权益，我们会及时下架他们内容，确保他们的权益不受侵犯。为了解决此问题我们希望能尽快得到你们的反馈，我们也可以通过电话联系，以下是联系方式：

谢谢

Dear Apple Review Team,
    We are sorry for the previous violation of the relevant provisions, and we have been actively cooperating to resolve our problems, but we have the following questions regarding our application of the recent review results, and appealed:
   First of all, the results of this review report that we violated the guidelines of 5.2.2 and violated the rights of third parties, but did not provide specific infringement content. We know that 5.2.2 guidelines are a wide range. If we do not know the specific violations of that party, Rights, we ca n’t make related changes to the application.
 Secondly, we have provided relevant certification materials according to the requirements. The certification documents we provided were authorized by the relevant authorized parties to enjoy the content services provided by the partners in accordance with the law. At the same time, they were also launched in China's major application markets. The feedback results did not explain us What is the reason for the document that does not work, that is, whether our document is not recognized by you or the document itself is not enough to prove that we have not infringed the rights and interests of relevant parties.
 Finally, at the beginning of the application, we provided relevant third-party content descriptions, listed the RSS feeds of related parties, and reminded users to read their terms. At the same time, we indicated the source in the application list and reserved the original page on the details page. Opened to view the original text in Safari, but the audit results did not tell us whether these changes meet the audit guidelines and whether they can solve existing problems.
   We have been actively cooperating with the rectification. We hope to resolve the related issues as soon as possible, to get specific reasons for rejection, and to provide us with some solutions. We want to solve them but we cannot determine the specific reasons. The feedback results are always large. , Did not provide a specific reason, if we did violate the relevant rights and interests, we will remove their content in a timely manner to ensure that their rights and interests are not infringed. In order to solve this problem, we hope to get your feedback as soon as possible. We can also contact by phone. The following is the contact information:
Name: xxx
Phone: xxx-xxxx-xxxx
Thank you
